# Takeoff
Takeoff is a crowdfunding app bulid with Solidity, Web3, React.js, Next.js, IPFS and Semantic UI.
With Takeoff there is no rentseeking middlemen to skim off of inventors or fundraisers.
It all happens automatically through the power of the Ethereum blockchain.
If the amount of money specified is not raised in the time alotted then the user's recieve their funds (minus 1% to cover the Ethereum costs).
